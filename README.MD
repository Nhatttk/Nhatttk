## ðŸš€ Projects

### [QR code and face-id login feature](https://github.com/Nhatttk/QR-code-and-face-id-login-feature)
The QR Code login feature is implemented using Django Channels and WebSocket technology. This enables real-time communication between the client and server, allowing users to scan a QR code with their mobile device to authenticate seamlessly. The QR code serves as a temporary, unique identifier that, when scanned, verifies the user's identity and logs them into the system.

For the Face-ID login feature, the face_recognition library is utilized. This powerful tool leverages facial recognition technology to authenticate users based on their facial features. By comparing a live image captured from the user's camera to a stored image, the system can verify the user's identity and grant access securely and efficiently.

These features enhance user experience by providing modern, secure, and convenient authentication methods.

### [CareerOrientation | Back-end](https://github.com/Nhatttk/CareerOrientation) 
CareerOrientation is a web-based application designed to help individuals discover and choose suitable career paths. The platform provides tools and resources for career exploration, personalized recommendations, and insights to guide users toward their professional goals.
