## ðŸš€ Projects

### [QR code and face-id login feature](https://github.com/Nhatttk/QR-code-and-face-id-login-feature)
The QR Code login feature is implemented using Django Channels and WebSocket technology. This enables real-time communication between the client and server, allowing users to scan a QR code with their mobile device to authenticate seamlessly. The QR code serves as a temporary, unique identifier that, when scanned, verifies the user's identity and logs them into the system.

For the Face-ID login feature, the face_recognition library is utilized. This powerful tool leverages facial recognition technology to authenticate users based on their facial features. By comparing a live image captured from the user's camera to a stored image, the system can verify the user's identity and grant access securely and efficiently.

These features enhance user experience by providing modern, secure, and convenient authentication methods.
